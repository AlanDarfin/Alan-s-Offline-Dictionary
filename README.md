# Alan's Offline Dictionary
A plugin for Obsidian.md that adds a sidebar with your offline dictionary.

# What is this plugin?
"Alan's Offline Dictionary" — or just "Offline Dictionary" if you’re in a rush — is exactly what it claims to be: a fully local, offline dictionary. In short, you create a note called "Dictionary" — or whatever other name you want (just change it in the settings) — and from there, you add your words and/or grab them from somewhere else. (ChatGPT, maybe?)

# Why does this plugin exist?
I'm a Writer, and having to switch tabs every time I need to check a synonym or antonym drives me nuts. While other plugins do similar things — like "Note Definition" — I don’t like cluttering my writing space. Underlines beneath words saying they have definitions? Nah, I’d rather just search in a menu on the side and move on. While I only partially made this myself — with *a lot* of help from ChatGPT — I did my best to keep this plugin simple and useful. So feel free to suggest new features and other cool ideas!

# Note Definition
Despite the criticism, you *can* use the Note Definition feature to easily add new words to your personal dictionary — it actually works great!

# How to use it?
Finally, a quick and dirty tutorial on how to add new words properly to the plugin.

Create something like this in your dictionary note:
```markdown

# word 1 <- required for the plugin to recognize it

word description <- optional, but mandatory if you don’t want to just collect words like Pokémon, lol

--- <- required between entries to avoid plugin meltdowns

word 2

```

Besides that, the plugin supports basic Markdown formatting — nothing too fancy (at least from what I tested so far).
